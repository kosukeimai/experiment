\title{Bounding the  ATOP when some of the Outcome Data are
Missing Under the Matched-Pairs Design}
\usage{
ATOPnoassumption(Ya, Yb, Ra, Rb, Ta, Tb, l, u, alpha, rep)
}
\arguments{
\item{Ya}{A vector of the outcomes of the first unit in the matched pairs. The missing values for \code{Ya} should be coded
as \code{NA}.}

\item{Yb}{A vector of the outcomes of the second unit in the matched pairs. The missing values for \code{Yb} should be coded
as \code{NA}.}

\item{Ra}{A vector of the missing data indicators of the first unit in the matched pairs.}

\item{Rb}{A vector of the missing data indicators of the second unit in the matched pairs.}

\item{Ta}{A vector of the treatment conditions of the first unit in the matched pairs.}

\item{Tb}{A vector of the treatment conditions of the second unit in the matched pairs.}

\item{l}{The lower limit of the outcome.}

\item{u}{The upper limit of the outcome.}

\item{alpha}{A positive scalar that is less than or equal to 0.5. This will
determine the (1-\code{alpha}) level of confidence intervals. The default is
\code{0.05}.}

\item{rep}{The number of repetitions for bootstraping.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{ATOPnoassumption} which contains the following items:
\item{LB}{ The lower bound for the ATOP.  } \item{UB}{ The upper bound for the ATOP.   }
\item{LB.CI}{ The lower limit of the confidence interval for the ATOP.   }
\item{UB.CI}{ The upper limit of the confidence interval for the ATOP.    }
}
\description{
This function computes the no assumption bounds on the average treatment effect among always-observed pairs (ATOP) when
some of the outcome data are missing. The confidence intervals for the
ATOP are also computed.
